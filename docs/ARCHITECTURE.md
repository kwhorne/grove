# Architecture

Grove is a Cargo workspace. A single long-running **daemon** binds the
privileged ports (DNS 53, HTTP 80, HTTPS 443) and supervises runtimes and
services. The **CLI** and **GUI** are thin clients that drive the daemon over a
local Unix-socket JSON-RPC.

## Crates

| Crate | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `grove-core` | Site registry, driver detection, TOML config, paths. Pure — no OS I/O or port binding. |
| `grove-ipc` | JSON-RPC protocol types + newline-delimited transport, and the client used by CLI/GUI. |
| `grove-tls` | Root CA generation + on-demand leaf issuance (rcgen/rustls). |
| `grove-dns` | Embedded authoritative resolver for `*.<tld>` (hickory). |
| `grove-proxy` | HTTP/HTTPS listeners, per-driver dispatch, SNI cert resolution, and a minimal FastCGI client. |
| `grove-runtime` | PHP version management + lazy FPM pools; Node version management; project scaffolding; the bundled toolchain (Composer, Laravel installer) exposed by `grove path`. |
| `grove-services` | Bundled service manager (PostgreSQL/MySQL/Redis) + the SMTP mail-catcher + cross-dialect database conversion + point-in-time database snapshots. |
| `grove-tunnel` | Native public tunnels: `grove share` client + the self-hostable `grove-tunnel` server (yamux + hyper). |
| `grove-os` | Platform integration: resolver setup, trust store, OS service install, elevation checks. |
| `grove-daemon` | The long-running process: boots listeners, supervises runtimes/services, serves IPC. |
| `grove-cli` | clap frontend (binary `grove`). |
| `grove-gui` | Tauri 2 + Svelte 5 desktop app + macOS menu-bar icon. |

## Request flow

1. A browser requests `https://myapp.test`.
2. The OS resolver (configured by `grove-os`) sends `*.test` to `grove-dns`,
   which answers loopback.
3. The request hits `grove-proxy` on 443. SNI selects/issues a leaf cert from
   the local CA. The `Host` header is matched against the site registry.
4. The site's driver decides handling: PHP → FastCGI to a lazily-started
   FPM pool for the site's PHP version; static → serve files; proxy → forward
   to the upstream dev server.

## Beyond native sites

- **Docker / OrbStack** — `grove-daemon` polls the Docker socket and merges
  running containers into the site registry as `proxy` sites (label- or
  compose-based). They get the same trusted HTTPS + dashboard, and can be
  started/stopped over IPC. See [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md).
- **Public tunnels** — `grove share` (in `grove-tunnel`) proxies a local
  `*.test` site — native *or* container-backed — to a public tunnel server over
  a yamux-multiplexed connection. See [TUNNEL.md](TUNNEL.md).
- **Xdebug** — when enabled, FPM pools are respawned with `-d` Xdebug INI
  overrides (trigger mode). See [DEBUGGING.md](DEBUGGING.md).
- **Toolchain on PATH** — `grove path` writes read-only shims that resolve each
  project's pinned `php`/`node`/`composer` version and `exec` it. Runtimes are
  provisioned by the (root) daemon (`ProvisionToolchain`) into the shared
  `runtimes/` dir, so the user-run shims never need write access. The shims
  themselves live in `~/.grove/bin` (user-owned, added to PATH).
- **Database snapshots** — `grove db` dumps/restores the bundled MySQL /
  PostgreSQL via their own client tools, indexed under `snapshots/`.
- **Reproducible environments** — `grove up` reads a project's committed
  `grove.toml` (`grove-core::ProjectFile`) and orchestrates the existing daemon
  operations (link, isolate, node pin, service install/start, dev start) so a
  fresh clone comes up identically in one command.
- **Request timeline** — the proxy handler records every request (method, path,
  status, duration) into a bounded in-memory ring buffer in `grove-core`
  (`RequestLog`), shared with the daemon so `grove requests` and the GUI panel
  can read it. Framework-agnostic; nothing is persisted to disk.

## Zero external dependencies

DNS, the reverse proxy, FastCGI and TLS are built into the Rust core (no
dnsmasq, nginx or OpenSSL). PHP, Node and the databases are downloaded as
self-contained binaries into `$GROVE_HOME`. The only host requirement for
scaffolding Redis from source / new Laravel projects is a C toolchain and
network access, which dev machines already have.

## State on disk

Everything lives under one base directory (`$GROVE_HOME`, or the platform
default such as `~/Library/Application Support/Grove`):

```
config.toml            declarative source of truth
certs/                 root CA + issued leaf certs (incl. certs/dev for Vite HTTPS)
runtimes/              PHP/Node builds, FPM configs, php-builds.json, composer.phar
services/              bundled DB/cache binaries + data dirs + state.json
snapshots/             database snapshots (SQL dumps) + index.json
logs/                  per-service logs
run/                   daemon IPC socket, pidfile, FPM/service sockets
```
